Please label this section of your career journal "Module 1 Journal Reflections" and [it's recommended that you use this template](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum-site/blob/master/career_journals/career_journal_template.md) to organize your responses. 

**For all journal responses, you have the option to submit a video or audio recording instead of a written response. We recommend using YouTube or Vimeo for these recordings and submit the link here in your journal. If you have any questions on this, please reach out to a member of the Career Dev team.**

### Mod 1 Week 1: Understanding your strengths <a name="week-1"></a>
Answer the below questions in a separate gist and link them into your career journal using this template:

Week 1: [Link here to your gist]
- [ ] (completed)
- [ ] (partially complete)
- [ ] (not started)

If you will not be able to complete your journal this week, please provide an update for the Career Dev team on when you'll have it completed here (remember to reflect on what you have control over, what you want to try differently this week, and what habits you can utilize to get back on track): 

1. Describe one of your strengths
* What is something you have learned to do well (list a skill)?
  * I can...
* What is something you know about (list some knowledge/expertise you have)?
  * I know...
* What is something you have a natural ability to do well (list a talent)?
  * I am...
* How could you combine these to describe a specific strength?

2. Read through your Top 4 results from Pairin
* In your own words, what do these top 4 qualities tell you about yourself?
* Do they resonate with you? Why/why not?
* How do they relate to the strength you wrote about in Prompt #1?

3. Challenges with strengths
* What can make it challenging to recognize your strengths? How can you work through those challenges?
* Do you ever see yourself overusing certain strengths? In what circumstances would you want to use them less and amplify other strengths? How could you adjust your approach in those instances?

4. Strengths in action
* Write 1-2 sentences describing how you like to work (i.e., Do you pre-plan? Do you talk through your ideas first? Do you work better with deadlines? How do you stay organized?)
* How could you describe these working preferences to your project teammates? Your mentor? Your instructors?
* What would you need to be aware of when working with people who have different strengths from you?
* How could your Pairin results help you better understand your everyday working preferences?

5. Continued growth
* Is there any particular strength you'd like to sharpen while you're at Turing? Any area you consider a weakness that you'd like to strengthen? 
* What are some steps you could take here?
* How could you be aware of progress you're making?

### Mod 1 Week 2: Building Your Compass <a name="week-2"></a>
Answer the below questions in a separate gist and link them into your career journal using this template:

Week 2: [Link here to your gist]
- [ ] (completed)
- [ ] (partially complete)
- [ ] (not started)

If you will not be able to complete your journal this week, please provide an update for the Career Dev team on when you'll have it completed here (remember to reflect on what you have control over, what you want to try differently this week, and what habits you can utilize to get back on track): 

1. Power of self-reflection
* What is challenging about self-reflection?
* How can you continue to build the habit of self-reflection at Turing? 

2. Social identity mapping

First, create you own social identity map on a piece of paper (or [print this out](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/blob/master/files/Social%20Identity%20Map.pdf)):
* Outer ring: write words that describe your given identity
* Middle ring: list aspects of your chosen identity
* Center: write your core attributes—traits, behaviors, beliefs, values, characteristics, and skills that you think make you unique as an individual. Select things that are enduring and key to who you are.

After you complete your map:
* Underline the items that are important to you
* Put a + beside the items that you believe clearly demonstrate that you fit into the tech industry
* Put a - beside the items that you believe do not demonstrate that you fit into the tech industry
* Put a ? beside the items that you're unsure how they could show your ability to contribute to the tech industry

Reflect:
* What does your social identity tell you about what you already bring to the tech industry? 
* What would it look like for some of your minuses or question marks to turn into pluses? In other words, how could some of these traits be assets for the tech industry?

3. Values mapping
Pull out 5 values for each bullet below from [this list](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wF1afCu5KqLfDa8rLiOH9ICfIWyjWZRS5Dba7UehYMc/edit?usp=sharing):
* Always valued:
* Often valued:
* Sometimes valued:
* Seldom valued:

Reflect:
* What do these values tell you about yourself? 

4. Workview & Lifeview
* Summarize what good, worthwhile work means to you (Tip: this is NOT about what work you want to do but about why work matters to you):
* Lifeview: summarize what you value in life; what matters to you?
* Where do your views on work and life complement each other?
* Where do they clash?
* Does one drive the other? How?

Ideas here are adapted fromÂ Atomic Habits by James Clear
Habits of a Software Developer
What do you think are the traits of a good software developer? What are they like in the workplace? What would you as a co-worker think of this person?
Habits of a good software developer include: patience, taking questions slow until they understand what is being asked, collaborative, listening, disciplined, persistent problem solver, responsive, detail oriented, asking for help, and being uncomfortable.
If I were to see a person with these traits, I would think of them as fantastic software developers and regular people. They are given a challenge and can use their resources to figure it out.  Additionally, they will keep their code clean so others can use it!
What are the habits that this person demonstrates to embody the identity of a software developer?
Persistence and discipline. As a developer, you are tasked with doing the impossible work. Problems may be challenging, and you may need to be focused on the direct topic to move forward. Besides that, chances of being uncomfortable are possible, and you may need ned to try new things or ask for help! In addition to giving support to other developers, like you may have received help.
Who do you want to be as a software developer? What kind of behaviors do you already have in place to be that person? What actions would you need to put into place? How will you do that?
I have other motives to be a software developer/engineer. I thrive off of travel and dance. I want to continue this lifestyle post-pandemic. But a s a dancer, and someone how has the privilege to travel, you have a lot of traits that can help.  I have perseverance and determination. I don't give up, if something is hard. I keep on trying, even If I fail multiple times. As a performer, I never want to look like I am struggling on stage. The hours that I put into mastery is a lot. I go through multiple rehearsals before it is ready to be delivered in front of stage. I have a feeling I want to do the same with developing before it reaches a customer.  With travel, you become better at listening, and getting a work view.  You build habits that help you resonate with others.  You become more empathetic.  
For me to succeed, I do need to become better at asking questions. In an online world, you need to format a question to be well understood, since it cant be seen then and there with a colleague next to you.  I have to collaborate more, offer my help, so I can help teach.  I also need to work a lot on typos and spacing.  I have millions of those errors that break my code. 
Working on the 1st Law of Behavior Change: Make it Obvious
Bring self-awareness to your current habits by making a Habits Scorecard. Make a list of your daily routines (examples: wake up, turn off alarm, check phone, etc.) as a way to bring awareness to what you do. Then, decide how effective that habit is for you and your goal of becoming a software developer. Put a + next to habits that are effective; put a - next to habits that are not effective; put a = next to habits that are neutral.
Wakeup +
Snooze -
Wakeup +
Read news +
Get ready for day (hygiene) +
Check phone
Class +
Lunch (working lunch) -
Check phone
Class +
Nap +
Turing Work +
Family time +

Sleep +
 
Pick 1 new habit you'd like to build and create an implementation intention following this template:
Background, I worked or Peloton before Turing. I was lifting bikes up and down stairs all day. I was taking a lot of dance classes. I was physically fit. It all deteriorated as I moved life to Mexico for an unidentified time.

"I will Exercise at 12 pm for 25 minutes in an open room."
"After exercise, I will eat lunch outside, without a phone, so I get enough sun and reduce screen time."

Design your environment for success: what changes could you make in your space to better implement your habit? 
I have an excellent environment to work out. It is a matter of creating space to workout. I have never sat down so much until Turing. And I need to reframe my thinking that exercise will help me physically and mentally.
How could you remove any triggers for bad habits? How will you implement these changes?
I can wake up 30 minutes earlier to get ready for school. Write down my questions, prep for the day. That way, I don't dedicate my lunch to a working lunch.  If I must dedicate my lunch to a working lunch, then I can take a dance class after.  It is fun, and active.  May not be the most intense physically, but also retains my muscle and coordination memory.
Respond after a few days of this implementation: What are your results? How do you feel about this method? How will you move forward with this habit?
I did not work out this week. But I did start again on Friday. My legs are sore from a simple work out. I feel much healthier. I have not been sleeping well because I forgot to disconnect my wifi. And I learned that it affects me.

### Mod 1 Week 4: Creating Your Vision, Part I <a name="week-4"></a>
Answer the below questions in a separate gist and link them into your career journal using this template:

Week 4: [Link here to your gist]
- [ ] (completed)
- [ ] (partially complete)
- [ ] (not started)

If you will not be able to complete your journal this week, please provide an update for the Career Dev team on when you'll have it completed here (remember to reflect on what you have control over, what you want to try differently this week, and what habits you can utilize to get back on track): 

1. Habits Reflection:
* How have you seen yourself become more aware of your habits? Have you tried implementing anything new? What have the results been? 

2. Start Where You Are (Empathize with the user -- *you*)
* Health: how you answer “how are you”; intersection of physical, mental, and emotional health
    * How would you rate your overall health on a scale of 1-5? How do you currently make time for activities associated with your health? What is a small change you could make here to readjust your health ratings?
    
* Work: what you do
    * Make a short list of all the ways you work right now; How much value do each of those things bring to your life? How are those activities purposeful for you?
    
* Play: what brings you joy? Think about joy just for the pure sake of doing it; everyone benefits from this kind of play 
    * What activities do you do that bring you joy throughout an average week? In what ways could you make a small change to bring more joy into your life?
    
* Love: sense of connection; who are the people who matter in your life and how is love flowing to and from you and them?
    * How does love currently show up in your life? How do you show love to others right now? What adjustments would you like to make in this area?
    
* Looking back at the 4 areas, do any problems emerge that you want to begin designing solutions for?

3. Define your needs, problem, and insights:

Based on what you wrote about above and your group conversation, what problems have you identified that you'd like to design solutions for? What do you already about what you want for your career? What do you still need to find out? Who or what do you want to grow into by the end of the Turing program? 

4.  Ideate -- challenge assumptions   

When you discussed software developers with your small group on Monday, what assumptions came up about what software developers actually do? What steps could you take to challenge those assumptions and find more facts to answer the question of what developers do? In addition to what a typical software developer life could look like, what do you want yours to include?

5. Prototype -- start creating solutions

What is the basic threshold that your new career must meet after Turing? What would you hope WILL NOT happen in your future after Turing? What is your absolute, no-holds-barred, ideal dream for your future after Turing?

6. Test –- solutions

Based on this week of reflections, write out your initial vision statement for your career:
